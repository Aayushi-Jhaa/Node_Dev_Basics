# Node_Dev_Basics

In this repository, you'll find three folders that represent my journey and exploration into Node.js development:  
1. **Node Basics**: This folder contains foundational Node.js code snippets that helped me grasp the fundamental concepts and syntax of Node.js programming.
2. **SQL with Node**: Here, I've documented my experiments involving Node.js and SQL databases. Everything from setting up connections to executing queries and handling data. 3. **MongoDB with Node**: Dive into the world of NoSQL databases with this folder, where I've delved into using Node.js with MongoDB.

Feel free to explore each folder to gain insights into my Node.js learning journey.

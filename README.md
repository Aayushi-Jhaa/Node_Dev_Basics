# Node_Dev_Basics

Welcome to my Node.js learning repository!
In this repository, you'll find three folders that represent my journey and exploration into Node.js development:

1. **Node Basics**: This folder contains foundational Node.js code snippets and projects that helped me grasp the fundamental concepts and syntax of Node.js programming.

2. **SQL with Node**: Here, I've documented my experiments and projects involving Node.js and SQL databases. From setting up connections to executing queries and handling data, this folder is a testament to my progress in integrating Node.js with SQL databases.

3. **MongoDB with Node**: Dive into the world of NoSQL databases with this folder, where I've delved into using Node.js with MongoDB. From CRUD operations to querying, my experiences with MongoDB and Node.js are captured here.

Feel free to explore each folder to gain insights into my Node.js learning journey and how I've applied these skills in various database scenarios.
